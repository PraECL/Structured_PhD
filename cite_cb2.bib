abstract = "This paper deals with a new efficient reduction method for predicting the stability analysis of a damped nonlinear brake system subjected to friction-induced vibration. The originality of the present work is to propose a generalized double modal synthesis method that combines a classical modal reduction and a condensation at the frictional interface by computing a reduced complex mode basis. Comparisons with the existing double modal synthesis reduction method are performed. It is demonstrated that the new suggested reduction technique is more efficient. It allows to provide satisfactory results with a small number of interfaces modes."

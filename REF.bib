abstract = "The construction of classical hierarchical B-splines can be suitably modified in order to define locally supported basis functions that form a partition of unity. We will show that this property can be obtained by reducing the support of basis functions defined on coarse grids, according to finer levels in the hierarchy of splines. This truncation not only decreases the overlapping of supports related to basis functions arising from different hierarchical levels, but it also improves the numerical properties of the corresponding hierarchical basis — which is denoted as truncated hierarchical B-spline (THB-spline) basis. Several computed examples will illustrate the adaptive approximation behavior obtained by using a refinement algorithm based on THB-splines."

These conditions apply, in particular, to the systems that result from the finite element discretization of linearly elastic bodies. From a numerical point of view, these conditions lead to studying eigenproblems relative to a non-symmetric (tangent) stiffness matrix that incorporates the effect of the current state of the contract candidate particles. Illustrative small-sized examples are presented, together with an application to the case of an experimentally tested block of polyurethane, where friction induced instability phenomena were observed."

abstract = "Friction-induced vibrations due to coupling modes can cause severe damage and are recognized as one of the most serious problems in industry. In order to avoid these problems, engineers must find a design to reduce or to eliminate mode coupling instabilities in braking systems. Though many researchers have studied the problem of friction-induced vibrations with experimental, analytical and numerical approaches, the effects of system parameters, and more particularly damping, on changes in stable-unstable regions and limit cycle amplitudes are not yet fully understood. The goal of this study is to propose a simple non-linear two-degree-of-freedom system with friction in order to examine the effects of damping on mode coupling instability. By determining eigenvalues of the linearized system and by obtaining the analytical expressions of the Routh–Hurwitz criterion, we will study the stability of the mechanical system's static solution and the evolution of the Hopf bifurcation point as functions of the structural damping and system parameters. It will be demonstrated that the effects of damping on mode coupling instability must be taken into account to avoid design errors. The results indicate that there exists, in some cases, an optimal structural damping ratio between the stable and unstable modes which decreases the unstable region. We also compare the evolution of the limit cycle amplitudes with structural damping and demonstrate that the stable or unstable dynamic behaviour of the coupled modes are completely dependent on structural damping."

abstract = "This paper provides a description of a phenomenological model representing a mechanical system consisting of a stator disk fixed to a clamped beam and a rotor disk. When the rotor is in contact with the stator, the rotation gives rise to friction leading to a self-sustaining vibratory instability called whirl. This instability confers a two-beam bending mode to the coupling. Moreover, adding detachment at the rotor/stator interface leads to the disappearance of whirl instability and the onset of another mode known as squeal. The main goal of this paper is to study the conditions of occurrence of the squeal mode. This is the first time a study has been performed to observe 3 different behaviors as a function of the parameters imposed. A limit cycle is associated with each behavior. Then, each limit cycle is studied using spectrograms and state space representation. Attention is then focused on the limit cycle bifurcation and limit cycle stability is studied using the monodromy matrix. Finally, a contact bounce is introduced in the model to observe a limit cycle consisting of alternating whirl and squeal modes."
